        The idea behind the building of this iconic statue is to commemorate the efforts and hard work that was put in by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in unifying India. This project was first announced by Narendra Modi in a press conference on October 2013. It was also said that this would be a form of Gujarat’s tribute to the nation. Overseeing the complete and seamless completion of the project was done by a separate society named Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust or SVPRET which was created under the chairmanship of the chief minister of Gujarat. An outreach drive in the name of Statue of unity movement was also started to support the construction of the statue which allowed farmers to donate their used farming instruments and created a lot of employment opportunities for them as well.
